Tick Based Strategy Game

Idea
----

The principle of IC was born from a project called [TurnEngine](http://www.turnengine.com/forums/). Who's creators, although very talented, had little idea of how to complete a project in a timely fasion, or keep their user base happy.

TurnEngine attempted to remove the compexity from creating a turn (actually 'tick') based stategy game, by creating a layer of abstraction below the game code, which handled all the common tasks that any tick based game might want to perform. Requring the game designer to merely define the units/structures, and generate set of rules and boundries within the game to operate in.

Using this technique they rebuilt their already popular game [DarkGalaxy](http://www.darkgalaxy.com) on top of TurnEngine, and to great success ran 5 or 6 rounds of the game on this code. At it's peak the game had about 30000 players, of which maybe 10000 were active.

Unfortunately the developers gave up on the project claiming that it was too difficult to maintain and too time consuming to administate the game. Even though numerous community members, including myself, offered to help both admin the game and develop the code, all offers were rejected and the game was closed down indefinitely.

Recently the developers have restarted the project, unfortunately it still suffers from the same issues as before; lack of activity and lack of letting the community help.

IC was started with the same concept, allow users to create great games with minimum effort, by writing a core code and allowing developers to either integrate directly with it, or extend it to suit their needs.

This example game is a clone of the original DarkGalaxy concept, with some much needed improvements and modifications.
